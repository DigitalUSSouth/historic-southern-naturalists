## Development
Simply, a one-time usage of `npm install` followed by `grunt` will compile and concatenate files responsibly.

Execute `grunt` after any changes are done within `src/**/*` or `js/**/*`. Alternatively, `grunt less` and `grunt concat` will be more specific, in order to save time on execution.
